Moved ! 
=======

jsarmor is [scriptweeder](https://github.com/lemonsqueeze/scriptweeder/wiki) now.

Migration
---------

To import jsarmor settings into scriptweeder:
* `Save Settings` in jsarmor 
* Remove `jsarmor.js`, install [scriptweeder.js](https://github.com/lemonsqueeze/scriptweeder/raw/master/scriptweeder.js), restart opera.
* `Load Settings`, done !

That's if you're using the new version. Older versions can't export settings, so in this case:
* Download [scriptweeder.js](https://github.com/lemonsqueeze/scriptweeder/raw/master/scriptweeder.js), rename it as `jsarmor.js` and install it over the current version.
* Now you can export settings, same as before.
